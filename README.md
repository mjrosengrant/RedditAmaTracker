================

My summer project to learn AngularJS. When completed I plan on being able to use it to check upcoming AMAs, search for past ones, and possibly subscribe to future AMAs. 

Technologies I'm expecting to learn and use:<br/>
HTML & CSS <br/>
AngularJS<br/>
Reddit API<br/>
Google Calendar API
